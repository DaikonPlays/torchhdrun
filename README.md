# Hyperdimensional Computing Library

The `hdc` library is a comprehensive package for all hyperdimensional computing related tasks.

## Installation

```bash
# Note: torch is a prerequisite of hdc, see: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ for an installation guide.
pip install hdc
```

## Creating a new release

- Before creating a new release, increment the version number by 0.1 to have the workflow update the PyPi documentation.
- On creating a new release, set the tag to be "v{version number}". Example: v0.5

New release should update both the PyPi library as well as documentation website.
